# Ch 4 Part 1 of DOET: KNOWING WHAT TO DO: CONSTRAINTS, DISCOVERABILITY, AND FEEDBACK
- What I found most interesting in Chapter 4 was Norman’s discussion of constraints and how they quietly guide us toward the right actions. The Lego motorcycle example really stuck with me. It’s amazing how such a simple toy can show how design can make things intuitive without needing words or instructions. I’ve definitely had the opposite experience when trying to do things like assemble furniture where every piece looks similar and nothing fits the way I expect. When the design doesn’t give clear physical or logical instructions I end up forcing pieces together the wrong way or spending hours guessing.
