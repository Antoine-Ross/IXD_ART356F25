# Ch 5 Part 1 of DOET:  HUMAN ERROR? NO, BAD DESIGN

- The part of Chapter 5 that stood out to me most was Norman’s argument that what we usually call “human error” is often the result of poor design. I’ve usually assumed that when I pressed the wrong button or sent a message to the wrong person it was only my fault. But the way he breaks down slips and mistakes made me rethink how many of those errors were actually shaped by the systems around me
  
-A moment that came to mind was when I tried to use a friend’s microwave and could not find the start button. I pressed a few buttons that looked right but nothing happened. I felt dumb at the time but after reading this chapter I realized it was not my fault. The design made the Start button hard to notice so the microwave guided me toward the wrong actions. Norman helped me see that many mistakes like this come from unclear design not from any error on my part
