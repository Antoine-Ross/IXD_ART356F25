# Ch 1 of DOET: THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS

- On pages 6 and 7 the text talks about how people were unable to find the hold function on a new phone system due to the new system being more sophisticated and the plate mounted manual beign confusing. This reminded me of when the button for the garage door was updated to the newer version at my house. On the old system I had to enter the code and press the open button to close it but with this new system all you had to do was press the button and the garage would close but if you were to enter the code and then press the button to close it like you would on the old system the garage would just stay open. This change couldnâ€™t be found anywhere in the manual.
- On pages 14 through 16 the author talks about conceptual models and an experience with his struggle to change the temperature on his poorly designed fridge. This reminded me of older tv remotes that had either unmakered or confusing colorful buttons that I could never figure out what they were used for, even on tv sets that i have used for years and could never find the instructions to figure out what they actually did.
