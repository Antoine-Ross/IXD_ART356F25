# Ch 1 of DOET: THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS

On pages 6 and 7 the text talks about how people were unable to find the hold function on a new phone system due to the new system being more sophisticated and the plate mounted manual beign confusing. This reminded me of when the button for the garage door was updated to the newer version at my house. On the old system I had to enter the code and press the open button to close it but with this new system all you had to do was press the button and the garage would close but if you were to enter the code and then press the button to close it like you would on the old system the garage would just stay open. This change couldnâ€™t be found anywhere in the manual.
